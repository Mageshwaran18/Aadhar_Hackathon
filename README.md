We welcome you to participate in the Online Hackathon on data-driven innovation for Aadhaar, organised by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) in association with National Informatics Centre (NIC), Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).

UIDAI has made anonymised datasets of Aadhaar enrolment and updates, available to the participating teams to identify meaningful patterns, trends, anomalies, or predictive indicators and translate them into clear insights or solution frameworks that can support informed decision-making and system improvements.

PARTICIPATION



Invisible Citizens 
**Invisible Citizens** is a data-driven analysis that evaluates the health of the Aadhaar ecosystem at the pincode level.
It compares child enrollment activity with demographic update intensity to identify regions where system engagement is unusually weak.
By applying population thresholds and socio-geographic enrichment, the project detects early warning signals of potential digital exclusion.
The results help policymakers prioritize targeted interventions in tribal, remote, low-literacy, and migration-affected areas.

Aadhaar Demand Response Mismatch 
This project analyzes Aadhaar data from 2025 to identify districts where update demand significantly outweighs new enrollments.
It introduces the Demand–Response Mismatch (DRM) Score to measure Aadhaar service pressure in a fair, district-level manner.
Using data-driven thresholds, districts are classified by degree of update pressure rather than arbitrary labels.
The analysis reveals that Aadhaar operations are predominantly update-driven, with clear regional variation in service stress.
These insights enable targeted, immediate policy action to improve service delivery and reduce citizen inconvenience.

1. Mobility Ratio :
- It identifies both things da Red area [ Labour Migration based on demo updates above 18 ] and Green area [  Stable family based on bio update ].
- By knowing these we can improve the infrastructure related to labour on labour migration places such as work hostel and stufss and in residential area [ green] we shall improve infra through hospital, schools.
- By this we shall spend the infra budget of government in right way to avoid the "Ghost School" -> indicating the school in not needed place.

2. Dynamic Demand Shifting
- It identifies the operational efficiency based on stress index so that we identify the amount of stress on each districts its based on aggrefation of all 3 dataset.
- once identified we calculate stress index to identify most stressed area to least.
- Since we do have the one year data, we shall predict in which area the stafss needed extra
- We need not to spend extra money for extra staff since we shift the staffs from area where stress index is 0 or near to zero.
- thus we reduce the idle time
